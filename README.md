Share Trade Profit Coding Problem 
In share trading, a buyer buys shares and sells on a future date.
Say the buyer was given the stock prices for n days and he/she was permitted to complete one transaction
(i.e., buy on one day and sell on one day), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit the buyer could have made in those days. 
Also print the buying and selling day to earn that profit. 


Input:  Price = [4, 10, 5, 12, 1, 3, 11, 9, 1, 2]
Output:  Buyer can make a maximum profit of Rs. 10 by buying on day 5 and selling on day 7

Explanation -
We have 10 days stock prices, starting at day 1, in order and they are 4, 10, 5, 12, 1, 3, 11, 9, 1, 2 respectively.
We are allowed to make only one transaction. A transaction includes buying on one day and selling on one day.
We can clearly see, if we buy a stock at day 5, at a price of 1 and then sell it on day 7, at a price of 11; 
we can make a profit of 10 which is the maximum profit possible.
